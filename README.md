# EU Data Act Practitioner Skill — Deployment Guide

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

**Status: pre-review (v0.9).** Foundation phases (architecture, source layer, method, gates, router) are complete. Scenario cards, templates, and eval loop are pending. Do not symlink into `~/.claude/skills/` for production use until v1.0 (post-eval) is released.

## Overview

Practitioner-grade analysis and drafting on **Regulation (EU) 2023/2854** (the Data Act). Calibrated for senior legal counsel, compliance officers, and product counsel working with the Data Act in client-facing or in-house contexts.

The skill's architectural anchor is **role × chapter × stage**. Every matter is positioned by identifying:

- which Data Act roles the parties play (user, data holder, data recipient, third party, customer, provider, public sector body, plus any concurrent GDPR roles);
- which chapter(s) of the regulation govern (II–VIII);
- which stage of that chapter's process the matter is at.

The anchor determines which references load and which scenario card the skill applies.

## Coverage

| Chapter | Articles | Operative depth |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Ch II | 3–7 | Full — IoT product and related service data; B2C and B2B sharing |
| Ch III | 8–12 | Full — mandatory B2B sharing under other Union law (FRAND, compensation) |
| Ch IV | 13 | Full — unfair contract terms unilaterally imposed in B2B data contracts |
| Ch V | 14–22 | Full — public sector exceptional-need access |
| Ch VI | 23–31 | Full — switching between data processing services |
| Ch VII | 32 | Full — third-country governmental access |
| Ch VIII | 33–36 | Gate-only, except Arts. 34–35 where they serve Ch VI |

### Cross-regime gates

| Gate | Reference file | Posture |
|------|----------------|---------|
| GDPR + ePrivacy | `references/gates/gdpr-overlay.md` | Operative when personal data or terminal-equipment access is in scope |
| Trade Secrets Directive (EU) 2016/943 | `references/gates/trade-secrets-directive.md` | Operative when trade-secret protection is claimed or asserted |
| DMA gatekeeper exclusion | `references/gates/dma-gatekeeper.md` | Operative on Art. 5 third-party requests and Art. 6(2)(d) onward sharing |
| Sectoral lex specialis | `references/gates/sectoral-lex-specialis.md` | Warn-only (vehicles, medical devices, DORA, NIS2, CRA, AI Act, eIDAS, energy, agriculture, telecoms) |
| Member State implementing law | `references/gates/member-state.md` | Warn-only (competent authorities, dispute settlement, penalties) |

## Deployment

### Claude Code (recommended once reviewed)

Symlink the skill folder into `~/.claude/skills/` once it reaches v1.0:

```bash
ln -s ~/CLAUDE_PROJECTS/SKILLS/claude-skills/skills/eu-data-act ~/.claude/skills/eu-data-act
```

Do not symlink the pre-review v0.9 build into production. Use a sandbox or local copy if you want to exercise the foundation work before v1.0 ships.

### Claude.ai (User Skills)

Upload the entire `eu-data-act/` folder structure under Settings → Profile → Custom Skills once v1.0 ships.

## Trigger phrases

- "Data Act" / "Datengesetz" / "Regulation (EU) 2023/2854"
- "Art. 4(1) request" / "Art. 5(1) third-party request" / "trade-secret handbrake"
- "cloud switching obligations" / "Chapter VI" / "Art. 25 mandatory terms"
- "Chapter V exceptional need" / "Art. 17 public-sector request"
- "Art. 13 unfair contract terms" / "Art. 32 third-country access"
- References to specific Data Act articles or recitals.

## Source layer validator

Run before any release or downstream symlink:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_sources.py --verbose
```

Checks heading taxonomy (every expected recital, article, and FAQ question), pointer-file presence, manifest checksums, and `_versions.json` structure. Exit 0 means all checks pass. Current state: 20/20.

## Regulatory basis
